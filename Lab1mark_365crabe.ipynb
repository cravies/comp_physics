    "\n",
    "For this part of the lab session, you are only required to follow the steps in the notebook and answer the corresponding questions yourself. Make sure you understand why `Julia` does what it does. **Don't spend more than the first half of the lab on part 1**.\n",

The second to last input shows that if no variable is assigned, it assigns the value of the calculation to `ans`. However, the third input produces an error message, telling us that our command was not a valid input that `Julia` could interpret. `Julia` tells us that the command ended prematurely, which is not suprising since addition needs two objects that are added together. \n",
